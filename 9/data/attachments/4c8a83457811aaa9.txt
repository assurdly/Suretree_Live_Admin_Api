This can range from a minimum of six months up to five years or even more. You\u2019ll be unable to access your money for the duration of the term. However, you\u2019ll receive interest every year that you have the bond, and this interest rate is fixed for the duration of the term.\r\n\r\nIn general, the longer you tie your money up for, the higher the interest rate.

Since the interest rate stays the same for the whole term, you\u2019re protected from the risk that interest rates might fall in the future. You\u2019ll also know from the outset exactly how much money you stand to earn.

Interest rates can be fixed or variable, meaning they may change over time. ISA interest rates are usually higher than you\u2019d find on other types of savings accounts (though typically they\u2019re not as high as the rates offered on regular saver accounts).\r\n\r\nOn the downside, there\u2019s a limit to how much you can deposit into an ISA each tax year. This is known as your ISA allowance. In the current tax year (2017/2018) this amount is set at \u0026amp;#163;20,000.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\n\r\nAny interest you earn is tax-free.\r\nIf you choose an easy-access ISA you can still have instant access to your cash\r\nYou can make regular monthly payments or occasional lump sums, depending on what suits you\r\nDisadvantages\r\n\r\nYou can only put in up to a maximum of \u0026amp;#163;20,000\r\nThe best interest rates are only available if you tie up your money for a fixed term.\r\nWhy choose an ISA?\r\n\r\nThe biggest draw for most people is that, unlike other savings accounts, any interest you earn on an ISA is tax free. You can pay in your cash any way you like - in regular instalments or as a one-off lump sum - provided you don\u2019t exceed the maximum yearly allowance. However, if you want to get the best interest rates, you\u2019ll need to tie up your money, which means you won\u2019t be able to make withdrawals for a specified term.
